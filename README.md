This page is for anyone who wants to understand the process of filing their taxes. Tax professionals often charge a lot for calculations that are straightforward once you know the steps. This tool and guide break down how it works, using the same logic the IRS and New York State use.

🤔 How Tax Filing Actually Works

Filing your taxes is essentially a math problem with two main parts:

1. Calculate Your Total Tax: Start with your total income, subtract deductions to find your taxable income, then apply tax rates. This gives you your tax liability—the amount you owe.
2. Apply What You've Already Paid & Credits: Subtract taxes already withheld from your paychecks. Then, apply tax credits (which directly reduce your tax bill). The final number is either your refund (you overpaid) or amount due (you underpaid).

This calculator automates that entire process step-by-step, showing you the impact of each piece of information.

🔑 Key Concepts That Shape Your Refund

The table below explains the core parts of a tax return and where they fit into the calculator.

Concept What It Means for Your Taxes Where to Find It in the Calculator
Filing Status Determines your standard deduction amount and tax brackets. It's based on your marital status as of Dec 31. The very first choice you make (Single, Married Filing Jointly, Head of Household).
Income & Withholding Your total wages (W-2, Box 1) are your starting point. The federal (Box 2) and state (Box 17) taxes already withheld are payments you've already made. Entered in the Wages, Federal Income Tax Withheld, and NY State Income Tax Withheld fields.
Dependents Claiming dependents (children or qualifying relatives) can qualify you for valuable tax credits that reduce your tax bill dollar-for-dollar. You'll enter the counts for different types of dependents in the fields under "Your Dependents".
Tax Credits These directly reduce your tax liability. Some are even "refundable," meaning if the credit exceeds your tax bill, you get the difference back. The calculator automatically applies federal credits (Child Tax Credit, Credit for Other Dependents) and the NY Empire State Child Credit based on the dependent information you enter.
Taxable Income & Brackets After subtracting your standard deduction from your income, the remaining taxable income is taxed in layers (brackets) at increasing rates. You don't pay a single rate on all your income. This is the internal math the calculator performs based on the projected 2025 brackets listed below.
